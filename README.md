# Bone Marrow / Stem Cell Campaign Cookbook
A guide for running a social media campaign to find donor matches for patients in need of a bone marrow / stem cell transplant

## About
### What this cookbook is for
This guide helps improve patients' odds of finding a matching donor for a stem cell transplant. Every year 50,000 patients with blood cancer or other blood disorders find out that they will need a life-saving stem cell transplant from a complete stranger. This stranger has a matching genetic profile, but can only be found if he has joined a marrow donor registry.

Social media campaigns are a uniquely meaningful way that anyone can help out to save the life of a friend or loved one by encouraging many others to join marrow donor registries.

### How this cookbook helps patients
Patients in need will find basic steps that they, along with friends and family, can take to launch and broaden their campaigns. The cookbook is more than a marketing task list. Its recommendations and perspectives are illustrated through actual stories of different patients who ran various types of campaigns to fit their unique situations.

### Why I'm working on this
On 21 March 2017, I received a life-saving stem cell transplant from an anonymous young man in Germany. I was unimaginably lucky. Of the 50,000 patients just like me who seek out a matching donor every year, about half will never find a match. Patients of color, including multiracial patients like myself, are overwhelmingly likely to never find their match. My experience has inspired me to do what I can to make sure that ever more patients can have access to the very same treatments that saved my own life.

### How you can help with this cookbook
You have the experience, skills and knowledge to help make progress on this cookbook in ways I never could. I'd love to hear thoughts from you on ways that you can help build out this guide for patients in need of finding a perfect match. You might be great at writing. You might have your own story. You might have connections to the marrow donor recruiters who specialize in this full time.
