# Bone Marrow / Stem Cell Campaign Handbook
A guide for running a social media campaign to find donor matches for patients in need of a bone marrow / stem cell transplant

## About
This guide helps improve patients' odds of finding a matching donor for a stem cell transplant. Every year thousands of patients need a life-saving stem cell transplant, but are unable to do so without an identified matching donor. Social media campaigns are a uniquely meaningful way that anyone can help out to save the life of a friend or loved one.

Patients in need will find basic steps that they, along with friends and family, can take to launch and broaden their campaigns. The handbook is more than a marketing task list. Its recommendations and perspectives are illustrated through actual stories of different patients who ran various types of campaigns to fit their unique situations.

On 21 March 2017, I received a life-saving stem cell transplant from an anonymous young man in Germany. This experience inspired me to do what I can to make sure that ever more patients can have access to the very same treatments that saved my own life.
